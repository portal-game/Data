This is the very first file read on the client
side on startup.

For this reason, this file is also the only one which is
stored at an unchangeable permalink. It is meant to tell
the client the URLs of the files that store all of the other
public data, such as servers and client binaries.

For this reason, the URL of this file should not be changed
unless absolutely necessary, because then the latest client
would have to be redownloaded completely.

It's good to have one static URL, so that all of the other
public URLs can be linked from this and changed easily
when necessary.
